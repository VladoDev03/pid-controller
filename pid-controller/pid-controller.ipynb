    "## Introduction ##\n",
    "A proportional‚Äìintegral‚Äìderivative controller (also known as a three-term controller, though this is not always accurate ‚Äì as we will see at the end of the Components section) is a feedback-based control loop mechanism commonly used to manage machines and processes that require continuous control and automatic adjustments. It is typically employed in industrial control systems where constant modulation is necessary without human intervention. Recently, it has also been used in everyday consumer technology. The PID controller automatically compares the target value (setpoint or $\\text{SP}$) with the actual value of the system (process variable or $\\text{PV}$). The difference between these two values is called the error value, denoted as $e(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three correcting terms sum up to form the manipulated variable ($\\text{MV}$). Let‚Äôs denote the controller output as $ùë¢(ùë°)$ Thus, the final form of the PID controller algorithm can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u(t) = MV(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \\int_{0}^{t} e(\\tau) \\text{d}\\tau + K_\\text{d} \\frac{\\text{d}e(t)}{\\text{d}t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$K_p$ (proportional gain), $K_i$ (integral gain), $K_d$ (derivative gain) are tuning parameters (more on that in the Tuning section)\n",
    "\n",
    "$e(t) = \\text{SP} - \\text{PV}(t)$ is the error\n",
    "\n",
    "$t$ is the time or instantaneous time (the present),\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\tau$ is the variable of integration (takes on values from time $0$ to the present $t$)."

    "## Example use cases ##\n",
    "Let‚Äôs start with three examples that we‚Äôll explore to help us understand what the actual operation of this algorithm looks like in practice.\n",
    "### Two-wheeled self-balancing robots ###\n",
    "A common example is a two-wheeled robot that balances itself. When the robot tilts forward or backward, the PID controller adjusts the wheel speed to maintain balance. This is achieved by continuously measuring the tilt angle and adjusting the motor power to restore balance quickly and smoothly, preventing the robot from tipping over.\n",
    "### Vehicle's cruise control system ###\n",
    "Another common example is the cruise control system in a car. For instance, when a car is climbing a hill, its speed will drop if the engine‚Äôs power output remains constant. The PID controller automatically adjusts the engine power to bring the car back to the desired speed efficiently, with minimal delay and overshoot.\n",
    "### Temperature control system ###\n",
    "Another example is temperature control in an industrial oven. If the oven temperature drops below the setpoint due to sudden heat loss (for example, when the door is opened), the PID controller increases the heating element‚Äôs power output to return the temperature to the desired level efficiently, minimizing overshoot and ensuring stable operation."

    "$$ P_{out} = K_p e(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $K_p$ is high, even a small change in error causes a large output adjustment, which can make the system unstable if set too high. On the other hand, a low $K_p$ leads to a weak output response even for significant errors, making the controller less sensitive and slower to react. If $K_p$ is too low, the controller might not correct disturbances effectively."

    "The PID controller automatically applies corrections to bring the $\\text{PV}$ to the same value as the $\\text{SP}$. The Proportional (P) component responds to the current error value by producing an output that is directly proportional to the magnitude of the error. At the same time, the Integral (I) component considers the cumulative sum of past errors to eliminate residual steady-state errors that persist over time, thus removing any remaining discrepancies. Finally, the Derivative (D) component predicts future errors by assessing the rate of change of the error, which helps reduce overshoot and enhance system stability, especially during sudden changes.\n",
